    <div>I've been in the tech industry since. During my time at Year Up, I discovered my interest in learning coding. The challenge of it was what drew me in. My internship was at Accenture where I was on the Modern Engineering team. From there, I was able to land a job at Zillow. Not exactly in software engineering, but in Business Operations. I put my development career on hold until now.</div>
