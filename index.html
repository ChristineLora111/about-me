<p align=left>I graduated from Mount Rainier High School in 2011. From there, I went off to Highline College in Des Moines. At the time, I didn't know what I wanted to pursue. I ended up getting an associates in Biology, because I thought I wanted to be in Sports Physical Therapy. I applied for the Exercise Science program at Seattle U and got in, however, I wasn't sure if that was the right career path for me. It just didn't feel right. I ended up doing a technical program called Year Up. It's a year long program for young adults wanting to pursue a career in tech. I never considered a career in tech at that time, but it was intruiging. It consist of 6 months of learning and development in either Software Development, IT tech support or QA testing. I decided to try it out. I figured, why not? It wouldn't hurt. It was only a year AND if it didn't lead anywhere, I would continue on with my Exercise Science career.</p>

<p align=left>I've been in the tech industry since. During my time at Year Up, I discovered my interest in learning coding. The challenge of it was what drew me in. My internship was at Accenture where I was on the Modern Engineering team. From there, I was able to land a job at Zillow. Not exactly in software engineering, but in Business Operations. I put my development career on hold until now.</p>
